# **Description**
This should be roughly a one-paragraph description of the project you want to make. It should describe how the final product well lookalso describe how it will appear or be used in the final product (e.g. "On starting a level, the game will generate a random, procedurally-generated map").

## SubFeature/components 
If the ticket contains multiple components, you should explain them in more detail here. Explain all the different parts that this project will need and the overall components that will make up this project

## **Examples **
- **Part/Feature**: Depending on the ticket, you will often want to provide some examples of how it would play out in the game. See next point for example...
- **map seed**: maps can be generated from a "seed" where there may be different attributes, e.g. island, mainland, etc.
# **Dependencies**

List any features on which this ticket relies. If there is already an existing ticket, reference it using #xx. If a feature needs to be implemented and the issue does not already exist... make a new ticket and leave it unassigned for someone else to take on.

e.g. Random game mode relies on random map seed generation(#xx).
